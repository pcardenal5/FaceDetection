    "### 1. Data Extraction \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the idea for the project was clear the first thing we had to do was getting a good quality dataset. Thankfully there is a plethora of datasets made for fface detection and we decided to use the one made by Gwangbin Bae, Martin de La Gorce, et al. on their paper\n",
    "\n",
    "> [DigiFace-1M: 1 Million Digital Face Images for Face Recognition](https://github.com/microsoft/DigiFace1M/raw/main/paper.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "the dataset is available for download on [their github page](https://github.com/microsoft/DigiFace1M). As the title of the paper may suggest, this is an artificially generated dataset of faces in which they aim to reduce the problems of dataset crawled from the web. They sey those datasets \"are severely biased (in terms of race, lighting, make-up, etc) and often contain label noise\", as well as posing ethical problems. Thus, we decided to go with a reduced version of this dataset. A sample of it can be seen on the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot of the sample dataset](FullFaceDataSample.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1: Screenshot of the sample dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted the model to train with the highest amount of different faces so we took a fragment of the whole dataset, consisting of 5 different expressions per face. This accounted for about 206.000 different pictures, far more than what we will need. \n",
    "\n",
    "This, however, poses another problem as we need to take our pictures in the same format as the chosen dataset; that is, we need to crop a picture of our faces, roughfly centered on a 112x112 pixel square. To overcome this problem we created a simple script, `dataCapture/PictueExtracion.py`, that takes care of it. using the `open-cv` python library we use our laptop webcam and save a 224x224 square that will later be resized. To help centering our faces we overlaid a blue square in the area that will later be saved. Originally, we took a 112x112 region but it was difficult and uncomfortable to take pictures. Thus, we decided to take a bigger area and resize it to fit the pixel dimensions of the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data has been collected we may begin preprocessing it."
